# Analysis-Portfolio

This repository has a collection of my analysis work including projects and research about applications. The files in the repo can be categorized into three sections. Here is a brief description of each of the files

# Case Studies
New age farming with data - Case study about Agrilyst, an analytics platform that collects farming data and empowers farmers to increase their yield by providing them customized recommendations

Walmart and Weather data - An interesting case study of how Walmart leverages weather updates to increase sales

Dodgers and Bobblehead promotions - Strategy presentation on whether the Dodgers should use bobblehead promotions to fill up emptying stadiums




# Machine Learning
Forecasting School Budgets - Schools are typically paid, and hence determine their budgets, based on the attendance rate of their students. To accurately forecast yearly budgets it would be beneficial if there were a way to determine if there is a relationship between student demographics and expected absences. Models used - elastic net regression, partial least squares, random forest and SVM

Movie Revenue Prediction - Through this analysis, I examine the possibility of predicting movie grosses through generally available information from websites like IMDB. Particularly, predictions prior to a movie's release in order to influence pre-production decisions. 


# Miscellaneous
Python Web Scraper - A scraper to pull metrics for counties in LA

Python Collaborative Filtering - An example of a recommendation system algorithm that predicts which book a user is likely to be interested in based on previously rated books

Exploring Olympics Data - One of my first analysis and visualizations, where I derive insights from 7 years of data from the Olympics games to derive insights like European and North American countries have a greater number of older athletes winning medals. We can explore the factors like healthcare, diet, physical traits of athletes from different nations as well as nature of sports they contest in to understand why older athletes in some countries perform better than others
