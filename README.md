# Analysis-Portfolio

This repository has a collection of my analysis work including projects and research about applications. The files in the repo can be categorized into three sections. Here is a brief description of each of the files

# Case Studies
New age farming with data - Case study about Agrilyst, an analytics platform that collects farming data and empowers farmers to increase their yield by providing them customized recommendations
Walmart and Weather data - An interesting case study of how Walmart leverages weather updates to increase sales
Dodgers and Bobblehead promotions - Strategy presentation on whether the Dodgers should use bobblehead promotions to fill up emptying stadiums


# Machine Learning
Forecasting School Budgets - Schools are typically paid, and hence determine their budgets, based on the attendance rate of their students. To accurately forecast yearly budgets it would be beneficial if there were a way to determine if there is a relationship between student demographics and expected absences. Models used - elastic net regression, partial least squares, random forest and SVM

Movie Revenue Prediction - Through this project, we examine the possibility of predicting movie grosses through generally available information from websites like IMDB. Particularly, predictions prior to a movie's release in order to influence pre-production decisions.
